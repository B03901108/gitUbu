     Hello, welcome to my git repository. This sub-directory
is a test about git on Ubuntu OS. There are some files here,
most of which are .txt files containing greeting message and 
.cpp/.h files containing simple code segments in C++.

     All the files in "gitUbu" is available to everyone, so 
feel free to read, enjoy and share them. However, plagiarism
is strictly prohibited. I will update the content in this sub
-directory casually whether visitors are interested or not.
